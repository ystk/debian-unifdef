unifdef (1.0+20030701-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to current FreeBSD version of unifdef.  This is effectively a
    switch to a new upstream version.  Really it is switching to a
    different branching of the original code base.
  * Suggestion to switch to the newer FreeBSD version. (Closes: #234054)
  * Whitespace is now allowed at the beginning of #if line before the '#'
    character.  (Closes: #204349)
  * Whitespace is now generally ignored around the preprocessor
    directives.  This allows indention of preprocessor control flow.
  * Previously only "#ifdef" and "#ifndef" preprocessor controls were
    handled giving the program the justifiable name of "unifdef".  Now
    general "#if" processing such as "#if defined(FOO)" and boolean
    expresions of those constructs are allowed.
